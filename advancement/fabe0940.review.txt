First, we should keep all these diagrams consistent with one another.
Variables and class names should be in CamelCase, whith the first word
beginning with a lowercase letter for variables and methods and with an
uppercase letter for classes. In addition, the '%' character is not part of
a valid identifier in Java, so the variable task_quests:Progression% should
instead become TaskQuests:progressionPercent.

Also, you are horrifically abusing inheritance here. To put it bluntly,
combat is not a type of stat, and neither is a quest. Stats aren't levels.
None of them have anything to do with the state stuff. Standing with
NPCs have nothing to do with the overworld, and are definitely not an
extension of an overworld. And then overwork inherits from quests? Circular
inheritance isn't even a thing. The other ones were absurd, but this is
blatantly wrong. The only inheritance here that actually might be an
inheritance is level inheriting from standing.

Finally, the main purpose of the advancement subsystem was to model the
NPC social network. The concepts of levels and quests are a part of that,
but a minor or incidental part at best. The entire heart of this subsystem
is missing.

If you have any questions about these comments, send something to the list
or jump on the IRC. I'll be around for the rest of the day.
