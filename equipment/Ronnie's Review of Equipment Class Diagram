1.) Just for the sake of convention, function names overwhelmingly 
        begin with a lower-case letter, and classes with an upper-case.
        
2.) I think having Inventory be the main class with 'Items' inheriting from it is good.
        From there, though, do you think that maybe it would be good to split it up 
        a bit more in regards to the classes inheriting from Items? Like, what if we
        had a 'Weapons', 'Support Items', and maybe 'Crafting Materials' classes that 
        inherit from Items? Just an idea, lemme know what you think.

3.) We currently have a showPlayerAttributes() method under the Inventory class. 
        Should this method be here? Showing player attributes seems like it would 
        be better suited for the Level Up class, right? 

4.) Under the Weapon subclass, there is a use() method. I think the method of using
        your weapon would be better suited for the Combat class, not the equipment 
        class. Unless, of course, you meant equip item, which, if you did, we should 
        move the equipItem() method from the Item class. 

5.) I think the design is clean. Looks real good.
