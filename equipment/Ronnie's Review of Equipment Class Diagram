1.) Just for the sake of convention, function names overwhelmingly 
        begin with a lower-case letter, and classes with an upper-case.
        
2.) I think having Inventory be the main class with 'Items' inheriting from it is good.
        From there, though, do you think that maybe it would be good to split it up 
        a bit more in regards to the classes inheriting from Items? Like, what if we
        had a 'Weapons', 'Support Items', and maybe 'Crafting Materials' classes that 
        inherit from Items? Just an idea, lemme know what you think.

3.) Could you fill me in on what the 'Work Project' class inheriting from Items is, exactly?
    Also, could you let me know the difference between the arrows that you are using?

4.) I think the design is clean. Looks real good.
