Welcome.

hi 
fabe0940
I responded to your review of the combat diagram; did you see that? 
sault
yes I did 
fabe0940
Alright. Let's see there... 
sault
Maybe player is a class, I assumed it meant the real person 
fabe0940
Yeah, that's the first thing. 
I don't really have a preference. 
I just was on autopilot and making classes for everything. 
So the question is, do we need to associate all the various models of the player with each other, or can they all be run seperately by the different systems? 
Also, do they need to influence each other? 
sault
I don't know 
fabe0940
I'm inclined to think that they might influence each other. 
Plus, then you can share classes like Inventory among systems. 
Still... that could go either way. 
Perhaps ask the group as a whole? 
sault
Wouldn't they player just be one big thing that can do all of the stuff? we are just describing one part 
fabe0940
Yeah. 
I suppose it probably is best to keep things seperate as a defauly... 
Yeah, I do like that better. Thanks. 
Next is... Inventories. 
Are they owned by a MoveList or are they used by a MoveList, or some other relation? 
sault
Used by movelist 
Associated, but not owned i think 
fabe0940
Alright. Makes sense to me. 
Next is... Inventory and Equipment. 
I'm curious why keeping equipment in the inventory is better. 
It feels odd to me, but that doesn't mean it's wrong. 
sault
I always thought of the inventory as all the stuff you have, and equipment the things you are wearing out of those things, but if we have a team on inventory, then it probably doesnt matter 
fabe0940
Actually... that's a good point. 
Let me go look at their stuff. 
Mm. They don't make a distinction. 
Let's scratch the Equipment, in that case? 
sault
sure 
fabe0940
Although their diagram is missing stuff, so they're probably not finished. 
I hope they're not finished... 
Anyways. 
Diagram Layout. 
Yeah, something clearer would be better, but I can't see a good way to do it. 
sault
Looking at it again, I can see the flow better 
fabe0940
Well, I did try it a few times. Still unhappy, especially with that curved arrow. 
sault
Should we make separate diagrams for inheretence and other relations? 
Its so little stuff that I dont think it would b worth the time, but it might make it look prettier 
fabe0940
Yeah, it might. 
Or, at least, moving inheritance to it's own document. 
fabe0940
So that leaves Combatant having a useItem() method. 
sault
It the items are associated to the movelist, then I think we can leave it out 
fabe0940
Easy enough. 
That about covers everything mentioned earlier. 
Any other thoughts or ideas? 
Also, which one of us wants to go make these changes now? 
sault
I can't think of anything else, and I can do it, but im going to have to get off the computer in a sec, but I will be back on soon 
fabe0940
Sure. 
If you'll do it, then that's great. 
Thanks. 
sault
yep.
