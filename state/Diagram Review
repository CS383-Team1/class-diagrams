Tyler Wittreich State Diagram Review:

1) After someone chooses a function in main menu, does it then go to an external main subsystem class?

2) I was wondering if some of these functions in the class point to different states in the game? 
  ex(combat, environment, task/quest, â€¦)

3) I was wondering if there are any connections from this main sub system class to any other external subsystem classes?  I do not know if there should be any connections, but just something to think about.
